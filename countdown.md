Certainly! I'll explain the selected code, which is the `updateCountdown()` function:

1. The function starts by creating two `Date` objects:
   - `now`: Represents the current date and time.
   - `tomorrow`: A copy of `now`, which is then modified to represent 3 PM tomorrow.

2. To set `tomorrow` to 3 PM the next day:
   - `tomorrow.setDate(now.getDate() + 1)` advances the date by one day.
   - `tomorrow.setHours(15, 0, 0, 0)` sets the time to 3:00:00.000 PM (15:00 in 24-hour format).

3. `timeRemaining` calculates the milliseconds between `now` and `tomorrow`.

4. The code then converts `timeRemaining` into days, hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - `days`: Total milliseconds divided by milliseconds in a day.
   - `hours`: Remainder from days, divided by milliseconds in an hour.
   - `minutes`: Remainder from hours, divided by milliseconds in a minute.
   - `seconds`: Remainder from minutes, divided by milliseconds in a second.

5. `Math.floor()` is used to round down to the nearest whole number for each unit.

6. Finally, the function updates the innerHTML of an element with id 'countdown', displaying the time remaining in the format "Xd Yh Zm Ws" (where X, Y, Z, and W are the calculated values).

This function, when called repeatedly (as it is with `setInterval` in the full code), will create a live countdown to 3 PM the next day.
